<h1>About</h1>
<p>My name is Niels and I'm a university student at the IT-University of
    Copenhagen where I study Software Development and Technology and expect to finish my
    master degree June 2016, with the specialisation
    <a href="http://www.itu.dk/Uddannelser/Kandidatuddannelser/Softwareudvikling#Specialiseringer">
        'Business Analytics'</a>.</p>
<p>During my education I've been exposed to a number of concepts within computer science. I have taken
    courses in discrete mathematics, algorithms and data structures, and data mining. See a
    complete list of courses I've taken <a href="#courses">further down</a>.
    During the next semester I will be taking courses on Big Data Management and Scala, among others.
</p>
<p>
    I have a bachelors degree in Business, Asian Language and Culture from Copenhagen Business School,
    where I studied Japanese and Japanese culture in particular.
    My bachelor project was written for a freight forwarding company in which we interviewed eployees
    and examined the relations with the asian affiliations.
    I focused on agency theory, which I still find very
    interesting and believe can be applied to many aspects of life.
</p>
<p>
    I decided to persue a masters in software development because I have always been interested in
    computer programming, and have an interest in combining the fields of business and information technology.
    In the future, I would like to see myself become a connecting element between the two, which
    I think is vital for any modern business wanting to succeed. By following the business analytics
    specialisation I ensure a silver lining throughout my university education where I can
    combine the two areas.
